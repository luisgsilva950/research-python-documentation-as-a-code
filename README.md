## SVG DIAGRAMS AS A CODE

Welcome to the SVG Diagram Generation Repository!

This repository aims to provide a collection of powerful and flexible scripts for creating diagrams in SVG format. The
diagrams generated by these scripts are especially useful for enhancing reports and documents, as vectorized images are
highly valued.

Key features and benefits:

1. **Programmatic Generation of Diagrams**: With our scripts, you can generate diagrams directly in your code. There's
   no need to use external tools or complex graphics editing software. This allows you to automate the creation of
   diagrams and customize them to meet your specific needs.

2. **SVG Format**: The diagrams are generated in SVG format, which is a widely supported vector image format. This means
   you can resize the diagrams without loss of quality, ensuring they fit perfectly into your reports and documents
   regardless of the final size.

3. **Flexible Customization**: Our scripts are highly customizable. You can adjust colors, sizes (not yet), labels, and
   other aspects of the diagrams to ensure they align with the visual identity of your report and meet your aesthetic
   preferences.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: We provide detailed documentation and usage examples to help you get started
   quickly. You'll find clear guidelines on how to install the necessary dependencies, run the scripts, and customize
   the diagrams to your specific needs.

Don't waste any more time manually creating diagrams for your reports. Take advantage of the efficiency and visual
quality of our SVG diagram generation scripts. Enhance the presentation of your data and concepts in a professional and
elegant manner.

### Documentation: State Machine

For create a state machine, you must define 3 important aspects:

- Title
- States
- Transitions

For execute it, you can follow this example:

```python
def example_state_machine():
    states = ['Home', 'Wait', 'Opponent Seek', 'Move Forward', 'Move Back']

    transitions = [StateMachineTransaction(label='Turn On', source=states[0], destiny=states[1]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='5s', source=states[1], destiny=states[1]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='T > 5s', source=states[1], destiny=states[2]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='Opponent not found', source=states[2], destiny=states[2]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='Opponent found', source=states[2], destiny=states[3]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='Edge not found', source=states[3], destiny=states[3]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='Edge found', source=states[3], destiny=states[4]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='100ms', source=states[4], destiny=states[4]),
                   StateMachineTransaction(label='T > 100ms', source=states[4], destiny=states[2])]

    return StateMachine(title="Simple Sumo Robot", states=states, transactions=transitions)
```

You also is able to define the box colors and diagram direction. See the example:

```python
StateMachine(title="Foobar", states=states, transactions=transitions, box_color=GraphColors.LIGHT_BLUE,
             direction=StateMachineDirection.BOTTOM_TO_TOP)
```

### Running Project

Build your code on `main.py` and run the main file. it should generate a svg file with the specified name that you put
on the code.
